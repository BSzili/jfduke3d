		<h1>Release Notes for JonoF's Duke Nukem 3D Port</h1>
		<p>Release date: 13 October 2004 (interim release)</p>

		<h2>New Features</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Sky boxes. <a href="#skybox">See here for more information</a>.</li>
			<li>Multiple skins per MD2 model. <a href="#md2skin">See here for more information.</a>.</li>
			<li>"Map hack" files for tweaking sprites in GL Polymost mode. <a href="#maphack">See here for more
				information.</a></li>
			<li>Models can now be flipped x-wise and y-wise.</li>
		</ul>
			
		<h2>Known Issues</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>IMPORTANT CHANGE:</strong> The definitions in the community high-resolution art packs
			have tile numbers with zeroes padding their length to four digits. This is a bad thing with this
			release because a leading zero indicates a number given in octal (base 8) representation. You will
			have to make sure that there are no extra zeroes before the first non-zero digit of the tile
			number or else you will see strange things in the game.</li>
			<li>3D model support is maturing. The evilest of bugs in the code should be fixed
			(eg. model "limits").</li>
			<li>The hightile crash caused by BMP files in the community texture pack ought to be
			fixed now.</li>
			<li>The multiplayer feature has been completely disabled for the time being. Work is proceeding on
			it.</li>
			<li>The existing sound code is the only stuff stable enough to use at the moment. I'm working
			on the new code still.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3><a name="md2sprite"></a>3D Models</h3>

		<p>Polymost uses the Quake II MD2 model format for 3D models. You can replace any wall-aligned or
		face sprite in the game with a 3D model using a declaration in the DUKE3D.DEF file. For more information
		on the specifics of the DEF-file commands for 3D models, <a href="#deffile">see here</a>.</p>
		<p>Included in this release is a model of the Pig Cop by Parkar, and the skin by Motionblur. Visit <a
		href="http://forums.3drealms.com/ubbthreads/showflat.php?Cat=0&Number=538967&page=0&fpart=19&vc=1&nt=21">this
		thread on the 3D Realms forum</a> for more model information. I shall use this model to demonstrate how to
		replace the Pig Cop character in Duke.</p>

		<p>Here is the definition for the pig cop which is also included in the sample DUKE3D.DEF file.</p>
<pre>definemodel "models/pigcop.md2" 1.30 0
definemodelskin 0 "models/pigcop.jpg"

definemodelanim "walk0" "walk13" 20 0
definemodelframe "walk0" 2000 2019

definemodelanim "pump0" "pump2" 10 1
definemodelframe "pump0" 2025 2027

definemodelframe "stand" 2030 2034

definemodelanim "shoot0" "shoot2" 10 1
definemodelframe "shoot0" 2035 2037

definemodelanim "dive0" "dive3" 8 1
definemodelframe "dive0" 2040 2044
definemodelframe "dive3" 2045 2049

definemodelanim "dshoot0" "dshoot2" 10 1
definemodelframe "dshoot0" 2050 2052

definemodelframe "die0" 2055 2055
definemodelanim "die1" "dead" 13 1
definemodelframe "die1" 2056 2059
definemodelframe "dead" 2060 2060</pre>
		<p>Without going through every line of the example, here is the basis of how the definitions work.
		You must put a
		definemodel line before any other definemodelframe or definemodelanim lines. The frame and anim lines
		refer the the definemodel line which precedes them. You can define frames and animations in any order, ie.
		the animations do not need to be given before the frames, but it is a good convention to keep them
		together for clarity.</p>
		<p>The walking loop for the pig cop spans tiles 2000 to 2019. The model contains a fourteen frame walking
		animation which we play at 20 frames per second. The first line of the example specifies the
		"models/pigcop.md2" model should be drawn at 1.3 times its normal scale and be left undarkened or
		lightened. The definemodelskin line specifies the skin to use for palette 0 for all the definemodelframe
		lines that follow it. The first of the definemodelanim lines declares the fourteen frame walking animation
		at 20fps which should loop (the 0 for the flags parameter says to loop). The definemodelframe line which
		follows it maps the ART tiles from 2000 through to 2019 to play the walking animation. Because the name in
		the definemodelframe line matches the first frame of the definemodelanim line, the animation will
		automatically play.</p>

		<h2><a name="deffile"></a>DEF-file Language</h2>

		<p>These are the legal instructions that may be used in the DUKE3D.DEF file. Comments can be used by
		prefixing the text with a double forward-slash (C++ style), <code>//</code>, or surrounding the text with
		<code>/*</code> (comment here) <code>*/</code> (C style).</p>

		<dl>
			<dt>include <em>filename</em><br />#include <em>filename</em></dt>
			<dd>Processes the script commands in <em>filename</em> at the point of the "include" call.</dd>

			<dt>define <em>label integer-value</em><br />
			#define <em>label integer-value</em></dt>
			<dd>Declares <em>label</em> to represent the numeric value <em>integer-value</em>.
			<em>integer-value</em> can be a label, in which case the value of the label given is used.<br />
			<strong>NOTE:</strong> You may find it convenient to include DEFS.CON or NAMES.H to predefine many
			of the tile names in the art file.</dd>

			<dt>definetexture <em>pic-number palette-number x-centre y-centre x-size y-size filename</em></dt>
			<dd>Defines a Hightile texture to replace an ART-file picture. <em>pic-number</em> may be an
			number, or a defined label. Use a value of 0 for <em>x-centre</em> and <em>y-centre</em> and a
			value of -1 for <em>x-size</em> and <em>y-size</em> for now until these values are actually used.
			<em>filename</em> may be any PNG, JPG, TGA, BMP, GIF or PCX file.</dd>

			<dt>defineskybox <em>pic-number palette-number reserved front-face-filename right-face-filename
				back-face-filename left-face-filename top-face-filename bottom-face-filename</em></dt>
			<dd>Defines a sky-box composed of six images mapped onto the faces of a cube to be used when
			<em>pic-number</em> is set as parallaxing in GL Polymost mode. For information on generating sky box
			images, <a href="#deffile-skybox">see here</a>. <strong>NOTE:</strong> <em>reserved</em> should be 0
			for now until its meaning is fully conceived.</dd>

			<dt>definetint <em>palette-number red green blue effects</em></dt>
			<dd>Defines a Hightile texture tint to simulate palette effects normally used on ART-file tiles.
			<em>red</em>, <em>green</em>, and <em>blue</em> are numbers in the range 0 to 255 which specify
			the colour the tint should look like. <em>effects</em> specifies any processing effects to use.
			Valid values are: 0 = no effects, 1 = greyscale image, 2 = invert image. These values can be added
			together to produce a combination of effects.</dd>

			<dt>definemodel <em>filename scale shade-offset</em></dt>
			<dd>Defines an MD2-format model file to replace certain sprites in the game. See
			"definemodelframe" and "definemodelanim" for details on how to specify the ART-file tiles to
			replace. <em>filename</em> is the name of the MD2 model. <em>scale</em> is a (possibly fractional)
			value specifying a scaling factor for the model when it is rendered, eg. 1.5 for one-and-a-half
			times as big.  <em>shade-offset</em> is an integer value specifying how much to bias the sprite's
			shade value by.  A negative value for this makes the model brighter. Conversely, a positive value
			makes it darker.</dd>

			<dt>definemodelskin <em>palette-number filename</em></dt>
			<dd>Defines a skin to be used on the model for all frames declared after this command, when the
			sprite palette is equal to <em>palette-number</em>. (This makes more sense when given a
			demonstration.) <strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> If your model exists in a subdirectory (ie.
			definemodel includes a path to the .md2) you will need to give the same path to <em>filename</em>
			if the skin is in the same directory.</dd>

			<dt>definemodelanim <em>start-frame end-frame frame-rate flags</em></dt>
			<dd>Defines an animation from a group of frames in the model given by the last preceding
			"definemodel" instruction. <em>start-frame</em> and <em>end-frame</em> specify the names of the
			starting and ending frames of the animation. <em>frame-rate</em> is the frame rate at which the
			animation should play. This value can be fractional. <em>flags</em> specifies any special
			properties the animation should have. Valid options are: 0 = none (looping animation), 1 =
			one-shot (plays beginning to end once and stops on the last frame).</dd>

			<dt>definemodelframe <em>frame-name first-tile last-tile</em></dt>
			<dd>Defines a range of ART-file tiles to correspond with the given frame of the model specified in
			the last preceding "definemodel" instruction. <em>frame-name</em> is the name of the frame, which
			if identical to the starting frame of a "definemodelanim" animation will play that animation. If
			the frame name is not corresponding with an animation, the replacement will be static.
			<em>first-tile</em> and <em>last-tile</em> specify a range of ART-file tiles which this model
			frame should replace.</dd>

			<dt>definevoxel <em>filename</em></dt>
			<dd>Defines a voxel to replace sprites in the game. See "definevoxeltiles" for details on how to
			specify the ART-file tiles to replace. <em>filename</em> is the name of the .KVX file containing
			the voxel.</dd>

			<dt>definevoxeltiles <em>first-tile last-tile</em></dt>
			<dd>Defines the range of ART-file tiles to replace with the voxel given in the last preceding
			"definevoxel" instruction.</dd>
		</dl>

		<h3>A note about numeric values</h3>

		<p>Whenever a numeric value is required, it can be specified in three bases: decimal (base 10),
		hexadecimal (base 16), and octal (base 8). Decimal numbers are obvious, but don't use extra leading zeroes
		to pad a decimal number to a particular width. A leading zero on a number indicates it is an octal number.
		To give a number in hexadecimal, use a '0x' prefix. These all represent the same number: 16 (decimal) =
		020 (octal) = 0x10 (hexadecimal)</p>

		<h3><a name="deffile-skybox"></a>A note about skyboxes</h3>

		<p>Ken has some utilities on his website that can assist you in converting your favourite skybox format to
		Polymost format. (<a href="http://advsys.net/ken/kube/kube.htm">http://advsys.net/ken/kube/kube.htm</a>)
		If your skybox is in Mercator projection, then you'll need to run MERC2KUB.EXE first. Once you have your 6
		face textures, you can use KUBE.EXE to convert it to Polymost format using the /split option. The face
		textures can be in almost any configuration - KUBE has fancy autodetection code. For example, typing "kube
		globe.mov /split" will generate the 6 face textures in the order and orientation that Polymost expects.
		The output files will be called SPLITCAP0.PNG, SPLITCAP1.PNG, ..., SPLITCAP5.PNG. After conversion, I
		suggest you rename the files and compress them using PNGOUT or similar utility.</p>

		<h2><a name="maphack"></a>Map Hack scripts</h2>

		<p>"Map Hack" scripts are files that override certain aspects of a map file when it is rendered in OpenGL
		Polymost mode. Currently they allow for angle adjustment on sprites, and the ability to prevent particular
		sprites from being drawn as a model. These are useful for making small corrections to ornamental sprites in
		a way that doesn't require modifying the original map.</p>
		<p>The game will automatically load a map hack script whenever a map is loaded. The script should have the
		same base name as the original .MAP file, but with an .MHK extension. The map hack language is described
		below. It uses the same parser as DEF files, so you can use comments in the same way.</p>

		<dl>
			<dt>sprite <em>number</em></dt>
			<dd>Begins a sprite definition. <em>number</em> is the sprite number to affect. You can find this in
			the Build editor by highlighting the sprite in 2D mode and pressing Control+Tab. The next group of
			commands describe the changes to make to the sprite.</dd>
			<dl>
				<dt>notmd2</dt>
				<dd>Prevents the sprite from being drawn as a model. It gets drawn as a regular sprite
				instead.</dd>

				<dt>angleoff <em>angle</em><br />
				angoff <em>angle</em></dt>
				<dd>Adds <em>angle</em> to the angle of the sprite just before it is rendered. This is good
				for fixing up things like toilet sprites that are facing the wrong way.
				<strong>angoff</strong> is a synonym for <strong>angleoff</strong>.</dd>
			</dl>
		</dl>

		<p>Here is an example map hack script:</p>
<pre>// Map hack file for JFDuke3D
// Level: E1L2.MAP (Original Atomic Edition version)
// Prepared by jonof@edgenetwork.org

		<h2><a name="hightile"></a>Hightile</h2>

		<p>This release features the "Hightile" texturing improvements to Polymost. Hightile allows Polymost to use
		true-colour textures instead of the artwork in the game's usual .ART file.</p>
		<p>Replacement textures can be saved as JPEG, PNG (alpha channel supported), TGA, BMP, CEL, GIF, and PCX
		formats. Hightile uses Ken Silverman's picture library to provide rapid picture file loading.</p>
		<p>Hightile textures are defined in the DUKE3D.DEF file. See the <a href="#deffile">DEF-file language</a>
		reference for information on how to specify Hightile textures.</p>
		
		<h3>Limitations to Hightile in this release</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Hightile will squash or stretch the replacement to fit in the dimensions of the original tile
			it replaces. Artists should keep their replacements in the same ratio as the original tile for the
			art to not look distorted.</li>
			<li>Duke does not precache textures yet with a great level of sophistication, so be aware that you
			will notice a small delay on occasion as a texture is loaded into memory when it is first seen.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2><a name="hightile-zip"></a>ZIP file support</h2>

		<p>Duke (and Build games in general) can load game resources from a ZIP file.</p>
		<p>ZIP files are used in Duke in the same manner as extra GRP files are specified. Use the "/g" command-line
		switch to specify the ZIP to load. eg. <code>DUKE3D.EXE /gMYFILE.ZIP</code></p>

		<h2><a name="polymost"></a>Polymost</h2>

		<p>Polymost is a full 3D implementation of the Build engine renderer, with hardware acceleration capability,
		and perspective in six degrees of freedom. In Ken's own words (copied from POLYMOST.C in my Build engine
		source distribution):</p>
		<blockquote><pre>
"POLYMOST" code written by Ken Silverman
Ken Silverman's official web site: http://www.advsys.net/ken

Motivation:
When 3D Realms released the Duke Nukem 3D source code, I thought somebody would do a OpenGL or
Direct3D port. Well, after a few months passed, I saw no sign of somebody working on a true
hardware-accelerated port of Build, just people saying it wasn't possible. Eventually, I realized
the only way this was going to happen was for me to do it myself. First, I needed to port Build to
Windows. I could have done it myself, but instead I thought I'd ask my Australian buddy, Jonathon
Fowler, if he would upgrade his Windows port to my favorite compiler (MSVC) - which he did. Once
that was done, I was ready to start the "POLYMOST" project.

About:
This source file is basically a complete rewrite of the entire rendering part of the Build engine.
There are small pieces in ENGINE.C to activate this code, and other minor hacks in other source
files, but most of it is in here. If you're looking for polymost-related code in the other source
files, you should find most of them by searching for either "polymost" or "rendmode". Speaking of
rendmode, there are now 4 rendering modes in Build:

    rendmode 0: The original code I wrote from 1993-1997
    rendmode 1: Solid-color rendering: my debug code before I did texture mapping
    rendmode 2: Software rendering before I started the OpenGL code (Note: this is just a quick
                hack to make testing easier - it's not optimized to my usual standards!)
    rendmode 3: The OpenGL code

The original Build engine did hidden surface removal by using a vertical span buffer on the tops
and bottoms of walls. This worked nice back in the day, but it it's not suitable for a polygon
engine. So I decided to write a brand new hidden surface removal algorithm - using the same idea
as the original Build - but one that worked with vectors instead of already rasterized data.
		</pre></blockquote>
		<p>Polymost is the default renderer choice for any video mode with a colour depth greater than 256
		colours.</p>
		<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> If your computer does not have an OpenGL graphics card, Polymost in OpenGL mode
		will most likely use the default Windows OpenGL rasterising facility which does all rendering in software.
		This may be extremely slow. If your Windows installation doesn't have any form of OpenGL rendering ability,
		Polymost will probably crash.</p>
		<p><strong>NOTE 2:</strong> OpenGL Polymost has been tested on an nVidia Riva TNT 16MB, an nVidia GeForce2
		GTS 32MB, an nVidia GeForce4 Ti4600 128MB, an ATi Radeon Mobility 9000 64MB, and a 3D-Labs Oxygen GVX420
		128MB (minor texturing issues).</p>

		<h1>Historical Documentation</h1>

		<p>The content in this section is here for historical reference purposes.</p>

		<h2><a name="network"></a>Network Games</h2>

		<p style="margin:1em;border:1px solid black;padding:1em;"><em>This information is here for reference only.
			The networking feature is currently under
			redevelopment. Although the code in this release works, it fails with more than two players trying to
			join.</em></p>

		<p>Because this feature is still experimental, setting up a network game is not the most streamlined of tasks,
		but it is achievable. First, some things to note:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Slow computers will fail to negotiate a connection with the game. I do not know where exactly the
			cut-off lies, but basically, machines which have worked are anywhere from a Pentium 3 1000MHz and
			upwards, while a Pentium 233MMX failed to achieve synchronisation. If you choose to test the game,
			your mileage may vary.</li>
			<li>Slow or laggy networks may prove to be a problem. This means no Internet play because the game
			quickly goes to crap soon after negotiating the connection, if it even manages that.</li>
			<li>I have noticed that sometimes at the end of a map, the game jams up at the intermission screen
			showing the player scores.</li>
			<li>If the game seems to be stuck waiting, try holding Escape for at least four seconds and hopefully
			the game will kill itself. If this fails to work, you may have to kill the game using Windows' Task
			Manager.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>So, knowing these particular nuances, this is how to configure a network game.</p>
		<p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> Place two or more blank lines at the end of the configuration files below
		or the game will start in single-player mode. This is a bug in my script loading code which I have not yet
		fixed.</p>

		<h3>Hosting a game</h3>

		<p>A machine hosting a game needs to create a configuration file which contains the following information:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The port to communicate on (if omitted, defaults to 19014)</li>
			<li>The number of players to wait for</li>
			<li>An indication of whether to host or join a game (in this case, host)</li>
		</ul>
		<p>This can be placed in a text file (which for this demonstration I will name <em>player-host.ini</em>) like
		so:</p>
		<blockquote><pre>[Network Game]
IPPort = 19014
Mode = "Host"
Players = 2</pre></blockquote>

		<p>To then start the game and wait for players to join, either create a shortcut to DUKE3D.EXE and modify its
		properties to use a command line like the following, or type the following at a DOS prompt.</p>

		<blockquote><pre>D:\Duke3D&gt; duke3d.exe -net player-host.ini -name JonoF</pre></blockquote>

		<p>The game will then start and wait for players to join.</p>

		<h3>Joining a game</h3>

		<p>A machine joining a game needs to create a configuration file which contains the following information:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The port to communicate on (if omitted, defaults to 19014)</li>
			<li>The address (and port) of the computer hosting the game</li>
			<li>An indication of whether to join or host the game (in this case, join)</li>
		</ul>
		<p>This can be placed in a text file (which for this demonstration I will name <em>player-join.ini</em>) like
		so:</p>
		<blockquote><pre>[Network Game]
IPPort = 19014
Mode = "Join"
Host = "asuka:19014"</pre></blockquote>

		<p>To then start the game and wait until the rest of the players join, either create a shortcut to DUKE3D.EXE
		and modify its properties to use a command line like the following, or type the following at a DOS prompt.</p>

		<blockquote><pre>D:\Duke3D&gt; duke3d.exe -net player-join.ini -name FonoJ</pre></blockquote>

		<p>The game will then start and wait until enough players have joined.</p>

		<h2>A quick word before we get to 3D Models</h2>

		<p>Before I explain the new 3D model support, I need to explain the changes which have been made to how
		the Hightile enhancements, 3D models, and voxels are described to the game.</p>
		<p>Users of previous releases of the port would be familiar with the "definetexture" instruction in the
		CON language which is used to declare Hightile replacement textures. Typically, you would have an extra
		CON file, often named EXTRA.CON, which you would use to declare textures and whatnot. This file would be
		passed to the game using a "/x" switch to override the default GAME.CON from executing. In order to provide
		more generic flexibility so that the enhancements are not tied to the CON language, I have created a new
		script loader as a service of the engine which is now used to read a file containing those same definitions
		which CONs once provided. This script file is named DUKE3D.DEF and its syntax is similar to the CON
		language.</p>
		<p>The benefits to come from this change to a separate file arrangement is that the new engine features now
		work in the Build editor as well as the game. Plus, the script reader is a reusable component of the
		engine which means any future games, or any modifications based on the engine will have the option of
		using this feature for themselves.</p>

		<h3>Converting EXTRA.CON to DUKE3D.DEF</h3>

		<p>Since the port now uses the DUKE3D.DEF file to specify replacements and whatnot, the CON features have
		been disabled and a warning written to the console put in their place, something like:</p>
		<pre>!!! BEGIN NOTICE !!!
CON-file definition of Hightile textures has been removed in
favour of DUKE3D.DEF declarations. Please refer to the release
notes for details on how to convert your CON definitions into
DUKE3D.DEF equivalents.
!!! END NOTICE !!!</pre>
		<p>Since DUKE3D.DEF has a syntax much like the CON language, conversion is not a difficult task. Refer below
		to the details on the instructions and their parameters for specifics, but here is the basic changes which
		you would need to make to an EXTRA.CON file to create DUKE3D.DEF:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>If you include GAME.CON in the EXTRA.CON file, you will want to change this to include
			DEFS.CON instead.</li>
			<li>If there are "definetint" lines, they must be checked to be sure to show five parameters. If
			there are only four parameters (which would be palette number, red, green, and blue values), add a
			0 to the end (which is the effects parameter that was option in the CON language).</li>
			<li>If any of the "definetexture" lines have filenames that contain whitespace, double quotes need
			to be placed around the filename. It is best to put quotes around all strings, but for strings
			with no embedded whitespace, quotes are not mandatory.</li>
		</ol>
